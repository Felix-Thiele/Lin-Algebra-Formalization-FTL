### Endresults


- Hom(K,V,W) is a vector space.

- A field is a vector space over itself.

- There is an injective function that is linear from a vector space to its double dual space.

- The unit group over a ring is a group.

- End(K,V) is a ring.

- V is a subspace of V.

- every subspace is a vector space.

- Let f be linear. Ker(f) is a subspace of V.

- Let Ker(f) be {0}. Then f is injective.
