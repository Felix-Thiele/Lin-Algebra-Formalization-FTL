# Linear Algebra in ForTheL

The goal of this project is to formalize some linear algebra in ForTheL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this code install Naproche-SAD and Isabelle.

```

```

## Project

### Idea

This project was developed to build a mathematical library for the formalization of linear algebra in ForTheL, a formal mathematical language close to natural language.

It is based on the lean file found under https://github.com/kckennylau/Lean/blob/master/linear_algebra/vector_space.lean.

An updated version of this (working with the current mathlib) can be found in our repository.

The lean file uses the mathlib https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib.

### Structure

This graph translates to the actual file readings in the following way:

### Results

The **definitions** of:
- groups, rings, fields
- vector spaces, subspaces, dual spaces
- homomorphisms, endomorphisms, automorphisms of vector spaces
- lists, linear independence

And the **proofs** of:
- A field is a vector space over itself.
- The linear maps between K-vector spaces V and W form a vector
space Hom(K,V,W).
- If f is linear, Ker(f) is a subspace.
- If f is linear and Ker(f) = {0}, then f is injective.
- Any K-vector space V can be embedded into the double dual space
(V*)*.
- The endomorphisms of a K-vector space V form a ring End(K,V).
- The invertible elements of a ring form a multiplicative group.


## Checking Times of the P_ Files
These times were recorded on a computer with an Intel Core i7-8700K and 16 GB of RAM.
They can depend on what files have been checked before each corresponding file.
