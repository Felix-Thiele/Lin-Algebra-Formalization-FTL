Definition. A field is a structure K such that
     (K has carr,zero,one,add,neg,mul,inv)
 and (K is an abelian group)
 and (1{K} < K)
 and (mul{K} is a function from Prod(|K|,|K|) to |K|)
 and (inv{K} is a function from |K|\{0{K}} to |K|)
 and (for all a < K     :       a *{K} 1{K} = a)
 and (for all a < K*    :          a /{K} a = 1{K})
 and (for all a,b,c < K : a *{K} (b *{K} c) = (a *{K} b) *{K} c)
 and (for all a,b < K   :          a *{K} b = b *{K} a)
 and (for all a,b,c < K : a *{K} (b +{K} c) = (a *{K} b) +{K} (a *{K} c)).
