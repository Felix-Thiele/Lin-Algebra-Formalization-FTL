Let K denote a Field.

Axiom. Let V be a vector space over K.
V2ddV(K,V) is injective.

Proposition.
Assume V is a vector space over K.
Let x be an element of |V|.
V2ddV(K,V)[x] is linear over K from dual(K,V) to field2VS(K).

Proposition.
Assume V is a vector space over K.
V2ddV(K,V) is from |V| to |dual(K,dual(K,V))|.

   
Proposition.
Assume V is a vector space over K.
V2ddV(K,V) is linear over K from V to dual(K,dual(K,V)).
