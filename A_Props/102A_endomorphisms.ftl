Let K denote a field.

Axiom. Let V be a vector space over K. Then id{|V|} is linear over K from V to V.

Axiom. Let U,V,W be vector spaces over K. Let f,g be functions.
Let g be linear over K from U to V. Let f be linear over K from V to W.
Then f*g is linear over K from U to W.

Axiom. Let V be a vector space over K. End(K,V) is a ring.
